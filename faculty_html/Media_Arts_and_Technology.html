                        <p>George Legrady, Distinguished Professor of Digital Media. He is former Media Arts & Technology department chair (2013-2017). Prior academic appointments were held at the Merz Akademie University of Visualization, Stuttgart, Germany (1996-2000); San Francisco State University (1989-2007); University of Southern California (1984-1988); California Institute of the Arts (1982-1984); and the University of Western Ontario (1978-1981). He was visiting faculty at UCLA, Nova Scotia College of Art & Design, and the National Academy of Fine Arts, Budapest, Hungary. Since 2017, he is a research fellow at the Institut des mines-telecom ParisTech, Paris, France and the iCinema Lab, at the University of New South Wales, Sydney, Australia.</p>

                        <p>The Experimental Visualization Lab (ExpVisLab) is one of 7 dedicated research labs in the Media Arts & Technology arts-engineering program at UCSB. The lab focuses on computational-based creative explorations in the fields of data visualization, visual language, machine vision, computational photography, interactive digital installations and related directions addressing the impact of computation on visualization. The experiments, projects and courses we do and offer contribute to the arts-engineering / scientific community in the following way: 1) Explore new forms of visualizations through implementation of advanced knowledge of visual language, image syntax and semiotics 2) Rapid testing of concepts through visual/spatial/interactive means 3) Address image-based research that are on the fringe of engineering / science research for artistic exploration. Research has been funded by the National Science Foundation, the Robert W. Deutsch Foundation, UCSB Center for NanoTechnology in Society, University of California Faculty Senate Research Grants, University of California Institute for Research in the Arts.</p>

                        <p>Legrady's artistic works have been supported by awards from the Creative Capital Foundation, the Daniel Langlois Foundation for the Arts, Science and Technology, the Canada Council for the Arts, the National Endowment for the Arts, and a John Simon Guggenheim Fellowship in Visual Arts in 2016. His commission for the Seattle Public Library, &quot;Making Visible the Invisible&quot;, begun in 2005 is a permanent installation consisting of algorithms that statistically analyze the flow of books and other media that are checked-out daily from the library to map out how library culture is changing over time. The visualization is scheduled for operation until 2019, with approximately 30000 items checked-out per day resulting at this time, in a collection of over 90 million datasets.</p>

                        <p>His contribution to the digital media field since the early stages of its formation into a discipline in the early 1990’s has been in intersecting cultural content with data processing as a means of creating new forms of aesthetic representations and socio-cultural narrative experiences.</p>

                        <p>M. Arch+Certificate of Specialization in CAAD (Computer Aided Architectural Design), Ohio State University, Professor (specialties: Media and Virtual Architecture, Transvergence, TransArchitecture).</p>
                        <p>Marcos Novak is a pioneer in the field of virtual architecture. In the mid 90s, his contribution to Inteational architectural discourse was further expanded by the coining and definition of the term "Transarchitectures" His approach: "we conceive algorithmically (morphogenesis); we model numerically (rapid prototyping); we build robotically (new tectonics); we inhabit interactively (intelligent space); we telecommunicate instantly (pantopicon); we are informed immersively (liquid architectures); we socialise nonlocally (nonlocal public domain); we evert virtuality (transarchitectures)". He has also posited a new "Soft Babylon," a theoretical stance which posits that our digitized architectural palette is causing us to create a wired Situationist city, while we struggle with some of the massive paradigm shifts that our era will and must face. Whilst articulating highly fluent theory, he has practiced, producing beautiful ethereal architectures that flux and shimmer as his algorithms run their designed logics. He received the Masters of Architecture at Ohio State university in 1983. Since that time he has taught at Ohio State, University of Texas Austin, the Architecture program at UCLA, the Digital Media program at UCLA, and the Art Center College of Design, in Pasadena. He has published, lectured and exhibited his work internationally.</p>

In the same year, the founded the technology branch of Projekt Atol called PACT SYSTEMS where he developed one of the first Global Positioning Systems based participatory networked mapping projects, the Urban Colonisation and Orientation Gear 144. He has been working on the Makrolab, a project that focuses on telecommunications, migrations and weather systems research in an intersection of art and science from 1997-2007, the Interpolar Transnational Art Science Constellation during the International Polar Year (project 417) and is currently coordinating the Arctic Perspective Initiative art/science/tactical media project focused on the global significance of the Arctic geopolitical, natural and cultural spheres together with Matthew Biederman. Peljhan has also been the flight director of ten parabolic experimental flights in collaboration with the Microgravity Interdisciplinary Research initiative and the Yuri Gagarin Cosmonaut Training Centre, creating conditions for artists to work in alternating gravity conditions. During the series of World Information.org projects, he has installed several communications mapping and interception systems and projects and his research led him to map the command and control communications networks and response during the Srebrenica genocide. He is the recipient of many prizes for his work, including the 2001 Golden Nica Prize at Ars Electronica together with Carsten Nicolai for their work, polar, and the UNESCO Digital Media Prize for Makrolab in 2004. During 2008, Peljhan was appointed as one of the European Union Ambassadors of Intercultural dialogue. His work was exhibited internationally at multiple biennales and festivals (Venice, Gwangju, Brussels, Manifesta, Johannesburg, Istanbul), at the documenta X in Kassel, several ISEA exhibitions, several Ars Electronica presentations and major museums, such as the P.S.1 MOMA, New Museum of Contemporary Art, ICC NTT Tokyo, YCAM Yamaguchi, Van Abbemuseum and others. From 2009 on he is the one of the series editors of the Arctic Perspective Cahiers series (Hatje Cantz and API). He holds joint appointments with the Department of Art and the Media Arts &amp; Technology graduate program at the University of California Santa Barbara, and was appointed as Co-Director of the Univerisy of California system-wide Institute for Research in the Arts in 2009, where he is coordinating the art/science Integrative methodologies initiative.

In a series of theoretical essays in the 1990s, he explored cultural criticism, the &ldquo;new historicism,&rdquo; and postmodernism in contemporary literary studies. In 1994, when he started his <a class="text_link" href="http://vos.ucsb.edu/" target="_blank">Voice of the Shuttle</a> Web site for humanities research, he began to study information culture as a way to close the circuit between the literary or historical imagination and the technological imagination. In 2004, he published his <a class="text_link" href="http://liu.english.ucsb.edu/the-laws-of-cool-knowledge-work-and-the-culture-of-information-catalogue-copy-and-table-of-contents/" target="_blank">The Laws of Cool: Knowledge Work and the Culture of Information</a> (Univ. of Chicago Press). Recently published from Univ. of Chicago Press is <a class="text_link" href="http://liu.english.ucsb.edu/local-transcendence-essays-on-postmodern-historicism-and-the-database/" target="_blank">Local Transcendence: Essays on Postmodern Historicism and the Database</a>. Liu founded the NEH-funded Teaching with Technology project at UC Santa Barbara called <a class="text_link" href="http://transcriptions.english.ucsb.edu/" target="_blank">Transcriptions: Literature and the Culture of Information</a> (recently renamed <a class="text_link" href="http://lcm.english.ucsb.edu/" target="_blank">Literature.Culture.Media</a>) and his English Dept&rsquo;s undergraduate specialization on <a class="text_link" href="http://transcriptions.english.ucsb.edu/curriculum/lci/" target="_blank">Literature and the Culture of Information</a>. During 2002-2007 he was a member of the Board of Directors of the <a class="text_link" href="http://www.eliterature.org/" target="_blank">Electronic Literature Organization (ELO)</a> and chair of the Technology/Software Committee of the ELO&rsquo;s <a class="text_link" href="http://www.eliterature.org/pad/" target="_blank">PAD Initiative</a> (Preservation / Archiving / Dissemination of Electronic Literature).

                        <p>W. Patrick McCray is a professor in the History Department at UCSB. McCray entered the historians’ profession via his background in materials science and engineering. His doctoral research examined the culture and technology of glassmaking in Renaissance Venice.  Since 1996, he has written widely on the history of science and technology after 1945 including two books: Giant Telescopes: Astronomical Ambition and the Promise of Technology (Harvard University Press, 2004) is an exploration of the politics, policy, and technology behind the current generation of ground-based telescopes while Keep Watching the Skies: The Story of Operation Moonwatch and the Dawn of the Space Age (Princeton University Press, 2008) chronicles the activities of citizen-scientists who organized a global network of satellite spotters during the Cold War.</p>
                        <p>When he arrived at UCSB, McCray became more interested in the history of nanotechnology and how it intersected with his prior research on the history of materials. He is a founding member and co-PI for the NSF-funded Center for Nanotechnology in Society at UCSB. He currently leads one of the CNS’s research initiatives; this explores the history of nanotechnology and its place in the broader context of the 20th century science and technology.</p>
                        <p>As a historian, McCray is fascinated by the visions of the future that litter the past. He is currently writing a new book about &quot;visioneers&quot; - people who used their technical expertise to promote visions of a more expansive future made possible by the technologies they studied, designed, and promoted. In 2010-11, he shared a Collaborative Research Fellowship from the American Council of Learned Societies with Cyrus Mody (Rice University) and Mara Mills (NYU) which will help support the writing of this book as well as a new project on &quot;high tech intellectuals&quot;.</p>
                        <p>In addition to this research, McCray is starting a new pilot project which considers the interaction between scientists, engineers, and artists during the first three decades of the Cold War. He is especially interested in the motives and ways these communities collaborated with one another, how Cold-War derived technologies such as lasers and digital computers were enlisted for artistic purposes, and the presence of Cold War themes such as nuclear war, cybernetics, and the Space Race in art from the 1950s, 60s, and 70s.</p>

                        <p>As AI decouples intelligence from consciousness, as XR technologies transform perception, and as matter becomes machine manipulable, three key questions about the future arise: <strong>1) what will newer AI-infused experiential interfaces look like where digital bits occupy space and algorithms have faces, 2) what can we learn about human behavior through human-AI interaction and how can AI models learn from human behavior, and 3) how will a shift from data-centric to human-centric AI systems augment our capabilities and enrich our lives?</strong> To answer these questions, our current work focuses on Human-Computer Interaction (HCI), eXtended Reality (XR), and Human-Centered Artificial Intelligence (AI). In particular, we investigate the design, engineering and study of human-AI integration through novel interfaces, interactions, tools and systems focusing on skill acquisition, task guidance and creative collaboration. Our goal is to create human-machine systems that extend the body and the mind, leaving us <strong>free to learn, to create, to think and to feel</strong> (Clynes and Kline. Cyborgs and Space. 1960).</p>

                        <p>Christina Tague's research is focused on the interactions between hydrology and ecosystem processes and, specifically, how eco-hydrologic systems are altered by changes in land use and climate. Much of her work involves developing and using spatial simulation models to integrate data from multiple field-based monitoring studies in order to generalize results to larger watersheds. Reflecting that emphasis, she is one of the principal developers of the Regional Hydro-Ecologic Simulation System (RHESSys), an integrated model of spatially distributed carbon, water, and nitrogen cycling. RHESSys is designed to provide science-based information about spatial patterns of ecosystem health and vulnerability in terms of water quantity and quality. Professor Tague is currently modeling the impacts of climate change on stream-flow patterns in the western United States and examining how urbanization alters drainage patterns and associated biogeochemical cycling in watersheds in Baltimore, Maryland, and Southern California.</p>

                        <p>Curtis Roads creates, teaches, and pursues research in the interdisciplinary territory spanning music and sound technology. He studied electronic music and computer music composition at California Institute of the Arts (CalArts) and the University of California, San Diego (UCSD) and received a Doctorate from the Universit&eacute; Paris 8.</p>

                        <p>He was Editor and Associate Editor of Computer Music Journal (The MIT Press) from 1978 to 2000, and cofounded the International Computer Music Association (ICMA) in 1979.</p>

                        <p>A researcher at MIT (1980-1986), he also worked in the computer software industry for a decade. He taught electronic music composition at Harvard University and sound synthesis techniques at the University of Naples Federico II. He was appointed Director of Pedagogy at Les Ateliers UPIC (later CCMIX) and Lecturer in the Music Department of the Universit&eacute; Paris 8.</p>

                        <p>Among his books are the anthologies Foundations of Computer Music (1985, The MIT Press) and The Music Machine (1989, The MIT Press). His textbook The Computer Music Tutorial (1996, The MIT Press) is widely adopted as a standard classroom text and has been published in French (1999, third edition 2016), Japanese (2001), and Chinese (2011). He edited the anthology Musical Signal Processing in 1997. His book, Microsound (2001, The MIT Press) presents the techniques and aesthetics of composition with sound particles.</p>

                        <p>A pioneer in the development of granular synthesis (1974), he also developed (with Alberto de Campo) the program PulsarGenerator (2001), distributed by the Center for Research in Electronic Art Technology (CREATE) at UCSB. In 2008, CREATE released EmissionControl, a new program for sound granulation written by David Thall in consultation with Curtis Roads. In 2013-2016, he collaborated with programmer Sekhar Ramakrishnan to design SpatialChords, a front-end to Ramakrishnan’s Zirkonium spatializer program, based on a theory of &quot;spatial chords&quot; or geometric forms in three-dimensional sound space. The software was tested in performances on the 48.4 speaker Klangdom of the ZKM, the 54.1 AlloSphere at UCSB, and the 28.2 sound system of the Mumuth in Graz, Austria.</p>

                        <p>His composition Clang-tint (1994) was commissioned by the Japanese Ministry of Culture (Bunka-cho) and the Kunitachi College of Music, Tokyo. His music is available on discs produced by the MIT Media Laboratory, Wergo, Mode, and Presto!?, among others. His collection of electronic music compositions POINT LINE CLOUD won the Award of Distinction at the 2002 Ars Electronica in Linz and was released as a CD + DVD on the Asphodel label in 2005.</p>

                        <p>In 2010 he was awarded the lifetime achievement award from the Society for Electro-Acoustic Music in the United States (SEAMUS). In 2016 he was awarded the Giga-Hertz Prize by the ZKM, Karlsruhe, and Sudwest Rundfunk, Baden-Baden.</p>

                        <p>In 2004, he began researching a new method of sound analysis that is the analytical counterpart of granular synthesis called dictionary-based pursuit (DBP). His research partners included Garry Kling, Bob Sturm, Aaron McLaren, and John Shynk. This research was sponsored by the National Science Foundation in 2007-2009 and resulted in a Best Paper award at the 2008 International Computer Music Conference.</p>

                        <p>His book <em>Composing Electronic Music: A New Aesthetic</em> (Oxford University Press) appeared in 2015.</p>
                        <p>A new Second Edition of <em>The Computer Music Tutorial</em> (MIT Press) was published in June 2023.</p>
                        <p>A collection of new electronic music called <em>Flicker Tone Pulse</em>, with visualizations by Brian O’Reilly is now available on a Wergo DVD.</p>
                        <p>His 2005 CD/DVD album POINT LINE CLOUD was re-issued by Presto!? Records, Milan in 2019.</p>
                        <p>The Slowscan label released in 2021 a collection of his electronic music on vinyl LP.</p>
                        <p>CREATE released the real-time granulation app EmissionControl2 for MacOS, Windows, and Linux in 2020. The EC2 project was realized by a team consisting of Roads as project manager, with software developers Jack Kilgore and Rodney Duplessis. The new release (2021) includes support for Open Sound Control.</p>

                        <p>Matthew Turk is current President of the Toyota Technological Institute at Chicago, an independent philanthropically endowed graduate research institute that focuses on computer science theory and artificial intelligence. He is interested in expanding the ways in which people interact with computers. &quot;Graphical user interfaces are very useful and quite appropriate for some uses of computers, but the computing landscape is changing: we are moving beyond the days when computers are primarily boxes that sit on a desk, used for spreadsheets and word processing. Computers are becoming more ubiquitous, appearing in a proliferation of shapes and sizes. They are being embedded into the world around us, and we are carrying (soon wearing) them wherever we go. We need new ways of conveying and accessing information, without requiring undue effort or attention on our part. We need to make computers accessible to all people in all situations. My particular expertise in this area is vision-based interfaces, using computer vision as an input modality: tracking, recognizing, and modeling people and their activity. New interface technologies become new tools for musical and artistic expression. MAT provides a great opportunity to explore this domain&quot;.</p>
