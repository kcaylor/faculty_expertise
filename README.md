# UCSB Faculty Directory

A tool for scraping, structuring, and enriching faculty data from UCSB departmental websites.

<!-- WARNING: THIS FILE WAS AUTOGENERATED! DO NOT EDIT! -->

## Project Goals

This project aims to create a structured database of faculty information from UC Santa Barbara's departmental websites, including:

1. Basic contact information (name, title, email, office, etc.)
2. Research specializations and expertise
3. Structured summaries of faculty research using AI
4. Department and inter-departmental relationships

The project uses a notebook-driven development approach with [nbdev](https://nbdev.fast.ai) to maintain well-documented, tested code with rich explanatory context.

## Features

- Specialized scrapers for different department website layouts (Drupal, WordPress, custom)
- Flexible `Unit` class to manage department-specific scraping and enrichment
- AI-powered faculty research summarization (using OpenAI)
- Utilities for crawling and analyzing faculty websites
- Modular design for easy extension to additional departments

## Developer Guide

If you are new to using `nbdev` here are some useful pointers to get you started.

### Install faculty_expertise in Development mode

```sh
# make sure faculty_expertise package is installed in development mode
$ pip install -e .

# make changes under nbs/ directory
# ...

# compile to have changes apply to faculty_expertise
$ nbdev_prepare
```

## Project Structure

- `nbs/`: Jupyter notebooks that define the code base
  - `00_core.ipynb`: Core data structures (Unit class)
  - `01_scrapers.ipynb`: HTML scrapers for different department layouts
  - `02_enrichment.ipynb`: AI enrichment and metadata extraction
  
- `faculty_expertise/`: Auto-generated Python modules from notebooks
  - `core.py`: Core data structures
  - `my_scrapers.py`: HTML scraping functions
  - `my_enrichment.py`: AI enrichment functions

- `faculty_html/`: HTML files from department websites
- `faculty_screenshots/`: Screenshots of department pages

## Quick Start Example

```python
# Scrape faculty from a department
from faculty_expertise.core import Unit

# Create a unit for Computer Science department
unit = Unit("Computer Science", "faculty_html/Computer_Science.html")

# Scrape faculty information
df = unit.scrape()

# Display the first few rows
print(df.head())

# Optionally enrich with AI-powered summaries (requires OpenAI API key)
from faculty_expertise.my_enrichment import enrich_faculty_row
row = df.iloc[0]
result = enrich_faculty_row(row)
print(result)
```
